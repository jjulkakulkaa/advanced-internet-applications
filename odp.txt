1. Controllers - actions with data, post, get ect, model-view connector
	Views - UI
	Models - specifies objects, data from database
2. Naming
    Models liczba poj - Movie
    Controllers - ends with Controller
    Views - named after controller without controller
3. Passing data:
    xxx["Mess"] = fdsfd
    xxx.Mess = fdsfd
4. using app.MapControllerRoute by providing pattern: pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"); - (in Program.cs)
5. ex. using atribute [HttpPost] before function to ensure using POST request ( [HttpGet] is used bu default when getting smth) (when filtering data there is no HttpPost because nothing changes in data its just filter)
6. ValidateAntiForgeryToken - prevents forgery of a request
7. Controllers and views takes validation rules automatically from model  
In controllers - ModelState.IsValid - if data is valid then its saved
	In models - by attributes ex.
    [RegularExpression(@"^[A-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9""'\s-]*$")]
    [StringLength(5)]
    [Required]
